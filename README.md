> In geometry, the area is defined as the region occupied inside the boundary of a two-dimensional figure. Therefore, the area of a polygon is the total space or region bound by the sides of a polygon.
>
> The standard units for the measurement of the area are square meters (m2).

```
double area(const vector<point>& fig) {
    double res = 0;
    for (unsigned i = 0; i < fig.size(); i++) {
        point p = i ? fig[i - 1] : fig.back();
        point q = fig[i];
        res += (p.x - q.x) * (p.y + q.y);
    }
    return fabs(res) / 2;
}
